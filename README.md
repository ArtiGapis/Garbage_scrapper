# Garbage scrapper

### About
The city cleaning company provides information on its website (Java calendar) on which days garbage is transported from individual houses.<br/>
Every year I (and most others) have to buy a calendar and mark on it all the days when the garbage will be taken.<br/>
I came up with the idea of extracting all of this in json format and putting it in google drive so I can check my house garbage schedule anytime.<br/>
In the future, it is possible to retrieve information from Google Drive through computer or phone apps and even generate reminders.
